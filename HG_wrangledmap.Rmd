## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Data wrangling for top 30 sustainable colleges data

library(rvest) 
library(purrr)

#Confirm bots allowed to access page

#   html_text()

#trying to read in my excel sheet

Top30 <- read_excel("~/Documents/COLLEGE/Data Science/Data Science/Top30.xlsx")

#reading in sustainability data
Institutions <- read_csv("data/Institutions.csv")
Tuition <- read_csv("data/Tuition Costs for Common Institutions.csv")
Degrees_by_County <- read_csv("data/Degrees Awarded by County.csv")
Growth_by_County <-  read_csv("data/Growth in Awarded Degrees.csv")
colleges <- read_csv("data/ipeds_directory_info.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename("institution" = "institution_name")

#working on making a map based on my data

#Getting college data

joined_uni <- left_join(Tuition, Institutions, by = c("ID University", "Year"))

View(joined_uni)
sum(is.na(joined_uni))

#cleaning up joined_uni data so only have information I need
clean_joined_uni <- joined_uni %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(id_university, university_x, year, state_tuition, total_graduates, out_of_state_tuition, sector, completions) %>%
rename("institution" = "university_x") 
fuzzy_uni <- stringdist_left_join(clean_joined_uni, colleges, by = "institution")
# fuzzy_uni %>%
#   filter(is.na(state)) %>%
#   distinct(institution.x)
# sum(is.na(fuzzy_uni$state))

uni_map <- fuzzy_uni %>%
  filter(!institution.x %in% c("Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University)", "Messiah University", "Lyndon State College"))




#importing class size data
Summary_Tables <- read_excel("~/Documents/COLLEGE/Summary Tables.xlsx")
Summary_Tables <- Summary_Tables[-c(1:4),] %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename("institution" = "x2", "id_university" = "national_center_for_education_statistics",
         "enrollment_type" = "x3",
         "total_enrollment" = "x4") %>%
  
enrollment <- Summary_Tables %>%
  select(institution, id_university, enrollment_type, total_enrollment) %>%
  #just want the undergrad
  filter(enrollment_type == "Undergraduate Enrollment", !total_enrollment == "-") %>% 
  mutate(id_university = parse_double(id_university),
         total_enrollment = parse_double(total_enrollment))

enroll_map <- left_join(uni_map, enrollment, by = "id_university") %>%
  mutate(percentdegree = (completions/total_enrollment)*100)

#making map
enroll_map <- enroll_map %>%
mutate(size = case_when(out_of_state_tuition <= 20000 ~ 1,
                 (out_of_state_tuition > 20000) & (out_of_state_tuition <= 40000) ~ 2,
                 out_of_state_tuition > 40000 ~ 3)) %>%

  addCircleMarkers(lat = ~latitude_location_of_institution_hd2019, lng = ~longitude_location_of_institution_hd2019, popup = ~ paste0("Institution: ", institution.x, "\nOut of state tuition: $", out_of_state_tuition), weight = 1,  color=~pal(percentdegree), radius = ~size)

# hist(uni_map$out_of_state_tuition)
#changing the radius of the different circles
  

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#working on the county map
county_growth <- Growth_by_County %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
  county_growth <- county_growth %>%
  separate(id_county, into = c("test", "fips"), sep = "US") %>%
    select(fips, county, year, completions_growth)
county_degrees <- Degrees_by_County %>%
   janitor::clean_names()
  county_degrees <- county_degrees %>%
  separate(id_county, into = c("test", "fips"), sep = "US") %>%
    select(fips, county, year, completions)
#joinign datasets
county_data <- left_join(county_growth,county_degrees, by = c("fips", "year"))  
#leaflet dynamic
#tigris shapefiles and fips code

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
